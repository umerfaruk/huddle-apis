# Huddle APIs #

Huddle provide access to their services via a set of RESTful HTTP services. This project is a public repository for documentation and examples.

To get started developing against the APIs, you will need to [register for an API key](https://login.huddle.net/docs/index.html). Once you have an API key, you should check the [getting started](BasicConcepts) documentation.

As we roll out the APIs, we will put together sample code and API clients which will also be available at this page.

If you have any questions, or if you are interested in giving feedback, we recommend that you join the [Huddle API Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/huddle-api?hl=en)
